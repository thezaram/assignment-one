    <p>
      Hello! My name is Chizaram Anisimuo. I am currently a student at the
      university of Lagos and I'm on a journey to becoming a Front End Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy coding, watching movies, and sleeping.</p>
    <p>
      I'm currently enrolled in Alt School Africa studying Front End Engineering
      with the student id ALT/SOE/025/3560.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did I choose to join this program? I love that this program stretches
      to 12 months allowing me to learn at a comfortable pace and I believe it
      will provide me with the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in the
      tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose to study Front End Engineering because I have always been
        fascinated by how websites and applications are built, and I want to be a
        part of that process. I believe that front-end development is a crucial
        aspect of creating great user experiences, and I want to contribute to
        that.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal for the school of engineering program is to gain a deep
      understanding of front-end technologies and best practices, and to build a
      strong portfolio of projects that showcase my skills.
    </p>
    <p>My life code is to always keep learning and improving my skills.</p>
    <p>My favorite quote is "It's better late than never"</p>
    <p>My favorite color is Royal Blue.</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of fried plaintain and fried eggs.</p>
    <p>
      I've never been a fan of having a favorite artists or songs or even
      movies, I enjoy maybe not all genre just the ones that are pleasing to my
      ears for music and for movies the beginning has to be really catchy
